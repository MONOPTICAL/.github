<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

`MONOPTICAL` is a user-friendly intrusion and vulnerability detection system designed specifically for Kubernetes clusters. It continuously scans all running pods using an unique vulnerability detection approach that combines deep analysis with behavioral monitoring. When potential security threats are identified, `MONOPTICAL` immediately alerts administrators and closely tracks suspicious pod activities.

The primary goal of `MONOPTICAL` is to simplify and automate Kubernetes security, making life easier for SecOps and DevOps teams. The solution features an intuitive user interface, detailed logging capabilities, and straightforward configuration tailored to clusters running diverse workloads.

An outstanding feature of `MONOPTICAL` is its modular plugin system, which allows teams to easily integrate custom security checks tailored for specific vulnerabilities. Users can extend the platform by adding their own plugins to cover new or highly specialized security concerns.

This solution is ideal for teams looking for an all-in-one, easy-to-manage Kubernetes security system without the hassle of integrating multiple incompatible security tools. It effectively supports both large-scale deployments running numerous microservices and smaller, specialized Kubernetes environments.
